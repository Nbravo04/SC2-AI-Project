# SC2-AI-Project
An AI that plays StarCraft 2 versus either other AI's or the computer in game.

I have always been intrested in AI and decided to learn more about it myself. I also have a passion for gaming so I thought it would be
best to apply the two together. I decided to make a AI to play StarCraft 2, otherwise known as SC2, because I found lots of online help
and tutorials and thought it would be a great place to start out. I have been working on this for a few weeks now, putting in time when free, but am still far from being complete.

The AI can only play the Protoss race out of the 3 races in the game. It uses the pysc2 module provided by DeepMind and Keras and TensorFlow for learning.

A lot of this code was learned through tutorials provided by SentDex, https://pythonprogramming.net/starcraft-ii-ai-python-sc2-tutorial/
He has an entire series about coding a AI for SC2 and it was extreamly helpful for just learning about it. I hope that once I am complete
with this project that I can implement my own made AI for SC2.
